## Hey there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Web Developer based in Michigan. I love simple, powerful software that helps people live better lives. I keep my head in the clouds and my hands in the dirt; I love daydreaming about the possibilities while working on all the little things it takes to get there.
I'm currently working with [QA Wolf](https://qawolf.com) as an Automation Engineer having previously served as a QA Engineer and QA Lead.
